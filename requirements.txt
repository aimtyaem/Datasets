# Core dependencies (always needed)
pandas  # For data manipulation (CSV/JSON handling)
requests # For making HTTP requests (if needed for API)

# API Key handling (choose one of the following methods)

# 1. Environment variables (recommended for security)
# No specific package needed, handled by Python's os module

# 2. Config file (less secure, but sometimes convenient)
# configparser  # For reading configuration files (e.g., .ini)
# python-dotenv # For reading .env files (more common for API keys)

# 3. Directly in the script (NOT RECOMMENDED - least secure)
# (No additional packages needed, but avoid this!)

# JSON handling
json # Built-in Python library, no need to install

# Example API interaction (if needed)
# (Install only if your API requires these)
# aiohttp  # For asynchronous HTTP requests (better performance for some APIs)

# Other optional dependencies (add as needed)
# numpy  # For numerical operations
# scikit-learn  # For machine learning
# ...
